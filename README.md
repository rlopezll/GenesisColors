# Genesis Colors
Genesis Colors is a tool that allows you to view the color compression of the Sega Genesis console.

It has two modes: one lets you view the Sega Genesis color palette and see the color conversion it will perform on a specific RGB color. In the other, you can load an ASE file (from ASESprite or Libresprite) to see how the palette is converted, as well as detect color clashes that may occur during compression to 9-bit color.
