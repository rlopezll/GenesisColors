# Genesis Colors
Genesis Colors is a tool that allows you to view the color compression of the Sega Genesis console.

It has three modes: 
 - one lets you view the Sega Genesis color palette and see the color conversion it will perform on a specific RGB color. 
 - You can load an ASE file (from ASESprite or Libresprite) to see how the palette is converted, as well as detect color clashes that may occur during compression to 9-bit color.
 - You can load a CRAM file (exported from the Gens emulator or others) to view the complete palette loaded in CRAM.
